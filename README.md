# Webscrapper Hardware Praktikum TU Dresden

This is a webscrapper that looks if there is a new experiment at the 'Hardware Praktikum' (Computer Science) which you could register in. If there is one, it uses Twilio to send you a text message onto your phone. It's written in Java and uses Maven.

## Set up

You have to add a `Secrets` class, which contains all the necessary information.
